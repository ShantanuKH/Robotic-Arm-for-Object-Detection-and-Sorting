# Robotic Arm for Object Detection and Sorting


This project presents a prototype of an automated robotic arm using Arduino technology and servo motors for basic object detection and manipulation tasks. The arm is capable of detecting objects and performing simple interactions automatically.

## Hardware Setup

- **Arduino Board:** Main controller
- **Servo Motors:** Enable arm movements
          - Servo MG996R
          - Servo SG90

## Software Overview

- **Programming:** Arduino code to control servos and process sensor inputs
- **Algorithms:** Basic object detection and movement planning and code writting in Python
- **Development Steps:** Assemble hardware, develop software, test, and calibrate

## Key Features

- **Detection:** Sensors detect objects in the environment
- **Movement:** Arm performs basic interactions with detected objects
- **Prototype:** Initial version with scope for future enhancements
